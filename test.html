        <div class="highlight-tip">
            <strong>Try it out!</strong> Select any text on this page to highlight it with the Amber extension. Your
            highlights will be saved automatically and organized for easy access.
        </div>

        <h2>Intelligent Text Highlighting & Organization</h2>
        <p>
            Amber revolutionizes the way you interact with web content by providing a powerful yet intuitive text
            highlighting system. Unlike traditional bookmarking tools that save entire pages, Amber allows you to
            capture and preserve the exact passages that matter most to you. Every highlight you create is automatically
            saved to your local device using IndexedDB, ensuring your data remains private and accessible even without
            an internet connection. The extension seamlessly integrates into your browsing experience, allowing you to
            highlight text with a simple selection and click. You can organize your highlights into custom folders,
            making it effortless to categorize information by project, topic, or any system that works for you. Whether
            you're conducting research, studying for exams, or simply collecting interesting ideas, Amber keeps
            everything neatly organized and instantly searchable.
        </p>

        <h2>AI-Powered Summarization & Translation</h2>
        <p>
            Leveraging the cutting-edge Gemini Nano APIs built directly into Chrome, Amber brings advanced AI
            capabilities to your fingertips without requiring external API keys or internet connectivity for processing.
            The summarization feature intelligently condenses lengthy articles, research papers, or documentation into
            concise, digestible summaries, saving you valuable time while ensuring you grasp the core concepts. This is
            particularly useful when you're reviewing multiple sources or need to quickly determine if a document is
            relevant to your needs. The translation feature breaks down language barriers instantly, allowing you to
            translate highlighted text into your preferred language with a single click. Both features work offline once
            the AI model is loaded, making Amber an indispensable tool for multilingual researchers, students, and
            professionals who need to process information quickly and efficiently across different languages and content
            volumes.
        </p>

        <h2>Flashcards & Active Learning</h2>
        <p>
            Transform your passive reading into active learning with Amber's integrated flashcard system. Any highlight
            you save can be instantly converted into a flashcard, complete with the original text on the front and your
            personal notes or key takeaways on the back. This feature is perfect for memorizing important definitions,
            historical dates, foreign language vocabulary, programming syntax, or any information that requires
            retention through spaced repetition. The flashcard interface allows you to review your saved content in a
            focused, distraction-free environment, helping reinforce your memory through active recall. You can create
            dedicated flashcard sets organized by topic or folder, making it easy to study specific subjects when
            needed. Amber automatically tracks which keywords and concepts you've saved, helping you identify patterns
            in your learning and ensuring that important information doesn't get lost in the endless scroll of web
            content. Whether you're preparing for certification exams, learning a new skill, or building expertise in
            your field, Amber's flashcard system turns your browsing research into lasting knowledge.
